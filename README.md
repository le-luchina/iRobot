OOP. Random walks algorithm with "Rumba" cleaner

## Roomba Random Walks Simulation
Welcome to the Roomba Random Walk Simulation project! Here, I present an independent implementation of a fascinating assignment inspired by MIT's course 6.0002, "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science."

## Project Overview
This repository showcases my self-directed exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) and the implementation of the Random Walks algorithm. The star of the show? A virtual Roomba robot!

## Why Roomba and Random Walk?
In this project, I sought to apply the principles of OOP and random walks algorithm to simulate the intriguing behavior of a Roomba vacuum cleaner. It's a blend of robotics and computer science, where the Roomba moves in a random direction, much like its real-world counterpart. 

## Key Features
* Object-Oriented Design: I've meticulously designed the code using OOP principles, with clear classes and methods that encapsulate the Roomba's behavior. 
* Random Walk Algorithm: The Roomba's movements are powered by the Random Walk algorithm, adding an element of unpredictability and realism to its path. 
* Interactive Visualization: You can run the simulation and witness the Roomba's journey in an interactive and visually appealing way.
